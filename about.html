            Hey, <br>
            Thank you for checking out my blog!
        </p>


        <p>
            I am in my third year at Michigan State University studying information <br>
            science with a focus in human-centered technology, and a minor in <br>
            computer science. I have always had a passion for learning new<br>
            technologies and how they can help improve the daily life. My main<br>
            interests include web and mobile design, artificial intelligence, <br>
            graphic design, and data visualization.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of the computer, I am a member and website manager of <br>
            the Michigan State Accafellas. I love to travel, cook, and collect <br>
            unique watches.
        </p>

        <h3>My top three dishes to cook:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pasta olio e aglio</li>
            <li>Steak and potatos</li>
            <li>Homemade pastas</li>
        </ol>
