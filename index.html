            <h2>What's for lunch? I don't know</h2>
            <h4> Mitchell Schuldinger </h4>

            <p>
                Today has been a super super busy day, and I don't have much time<br>
                or any food to make lunch. Yet again I am going to sift through<br>
                my pantries and see what I can make.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                After a bit of searching I found:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 lb ziplock bag of uncooked, seasoned, hamburger meat</li>
                <li>A handfull of gluten free penne pasta noodles</li>
                <li>A half jar of vodka sauce</li>
                <li>A quarter of an onion</li>
                <li>A few bulbs of garlic</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Yes, I know I had pasta for dinner last night, but I am broke<br>
                and this is what I got. Let's try to make something out of nothing.
            </p>
            <p>
                To start I put the seasoned hamburger meat in a skillet and<br>
                started to cook it. While that was browning I brought a small<br>
                saucepan of water to a boil and added in the pasta. I let the<br>
                pasta cook for about 10 minutes, then drained it and set it aside.<br>
                I diced the onion and minced the garlic and added it to the skillet<br>
                with the meat. I let the meat and onion cook for about 5 minutes.<br>
                Then I added in the rest of the jar of the vodka sauce and let it<br>
                simmer for 5 more minutes. Lastly I added in the pasta, mixed<br>
                it around and put it into a bowl. Topped with with some parm and<br>
                called it a day.
            </p>

            <p>
                We'll call this dish, with the help of Duolingo,<br>
                <em>Penne alla vodka con carne</em><br>
                This was actually way better than expected, I give this one a<br>
                rating of 7/10.<br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not the actual dish I made. Thank google for this one.

            <h2>Dinner for tonight</h2>

            <p>
                I am not sure what exactly to write this blog post on, so I <br>
                decided to write this on the steps I took while cooking dinner<br>
                for myself and my girlfriend.
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I don't have a lot in my kitchen, so I am going to try to<br>
                make something out of nothing.
                <br>
                After looking around what I have, I found:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Angel hair spaghetti</li>
                <li>Frozen chicken strips</li>
                <li>A jar of arrabiata sauce</li>
                <li>A half a bulb of garlic</li>
                <li>grated parmesan cheese</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This is going to be a real easy dish tonight folks.<br>
                First thing first I put a few cups of water into a large pot<br>
                and brought it to a boil. While the water was getting to a boil<br>
                I threw a few chicken strips in the air fryer and set it to 360,<br>
                and set them to cook for 15 minutes. Once the water reached a boil<br>
                I added the angel hair spaghetti and let it cook for 8 minutes.<br>
                While the pasta was cooking I chopped up the garlic and threw it<br>
                in a skillet with some oil and added in the arrabiata sauce.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once the pasta was done I drained it and added it to the skillet<br>
                with the sauce and garlic. Then I chopped the chicken strips into<br>
                this slices. Added the pasta, now mixed with the sauce, to a bowl<br>
                and added the chicken strips and some grated parmesan cheese.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                And there you have it, <em>Arrabiata pasta with crispy chicken,</em><br>
                was the meal for this evening. This was a real simple dish, I'll<br>
                rate it a solid 6/10.<br>
                <br>
